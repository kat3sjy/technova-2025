# Ctrl+Femme

## Problem

The gaming space is mostly dominated by men, making it difficult for women to strive in this environment and find other women they can relate to. Many of the currently available networks do not focus on making a comfortable community for women to join and meet people with the same interests, making it difficult for many female gamers to step out of their comfort zone.

## Solution

We wanted to create a safe, close-knit community for female gamers to match and connect with each other. In a world where women are often overlooked and underrepresented in gaming space, Ctrl+Femme builds a social network with its users to forge authentic connections between all games, regions, and platforms.

Our goal is to empower women in gaming and challenge the barrier that discourages women from exploring the world of gaming. By offering a supportive community for women to gather and have fun together, we hope to create a space that prioritizes the safety of women online and empowers women to thrive in the gaming community.
